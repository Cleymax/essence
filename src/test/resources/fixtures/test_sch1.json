    "title": "Hippopotamus",
    "cleaned_text": "The hippopotamus is a barrel-shaped beast with a large head and short legs. Its hide is thick, brown, and practically naked. Its tail is short. Its feet are broad, with padded soles. The four toes on each foot end in four little hooves that spread out, helping the hippo to walk across the soft mud of riverbanks.\n\n\"Hippopotamus\" means \"river horse.\" The animal got this name partly because it spends much of its time in the water. And it may have been called a horse because of its great size or its wide nostrils or its little horselike ears. But its closest living relatives are the pigs.\n\nThe hippopotamus is far larger than any horse. A big hippo may be only about 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall at the shoulder. But it can be about 12 feet (3.5 meters) long and weigh more than 3 1/2 tons. The hippopotamus has the biggest mouth of any mammal except the whale. It has two tusks in the upper jaw and four in the lower. When it attacks, it can kill a smaller animal with a single bite. Usually, though, the hippopotamus would rather hide than attack. Often it will run to the water to hide.\n\nA hippo can run as fast as a person. In the water it can drop out of sight like a stone or it can float. When the hippo floats, only its bulging nostrils and eyes and its little ears show above the surface. It is almost hidden, but it can still breathe, smell, see, and hear.\n\nWhen it sinks, the hippo closes its nostrils to keep the water out of its nose. It can walk around on the bottom and gather the juicy water plants it likes to eat. It can easily stay under for 8 or 9 minutes. In a zoo a hippo once stayed under for 29 minutes.\n\nThe baby hippo is usually born right in the water. It can swim almost as soon as it is born. Sometimes it nurses under water, coming up now and then for air. If a mother and her calf are going to swim a long way, the baby sometimes rides on the mother's back.\n\nA million years ago or more, certain kinds of hippos lived in India, Europe, and England, as well as in Africa. Today they live only in Africa. They usually live together in herds.\n\nThe hippo has an appetite to match its size. A big hippo that lives in a zoo may eat about 100 pounds (45 kilograms) of food a day. A herd in the wild will eat many kinds of river plants and grasses. Hippos usually feed at night and rest during the day. Sometimes they raid farms and eat the crops. As a result, many hippos in Africa have been killed or driven away from farming areas. Now they live mostly in tropical central Africa, usually around rivers and lakes in the parks set aside for wild animals.\n\nSome people say that when the hippopotamus is excited, it sweats blood. It does not, but its skin does give off drops of reddish oil as a kind of sweat. The oil looks somewhat like blood.\n\nThe big hippo has a small cousin called the pygmy hippo. It looks like the big hippo. But its legs are longer for its size. And its body is much smaller. It is about 3 feet (1 meter) tall and weighs under 650 pounds (300 kilograms). Its oily sweat is clear, not red.",
